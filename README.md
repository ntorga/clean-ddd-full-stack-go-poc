# Clean Architecture & DDD with Go, Tailwind, Alpine.js, HTMX, and SQLite: A Proof of Concept

## Introduction
> The center of your application is not the database. Nor is it one or more of the frameworks you may be using. **The center of your application is the use cases of your application**  -  _Unclebob_ ([source](https://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2012/05/15/NODB.html "NODB"))

This project builds upon the principles demonstrated in the [PHP version](https://github.com/ntorga/clean-ddd-php-poc-contacts) of our Clean Architecture and Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Proof of Concept (PoC). Before diving into this Go implementation, we recommend familiarizing yourself with the PHP version to grasp the foundational concepts that drive this project.

## Objective
The primary aim with this Go-based PoC is to explore and demonstrate how Clean Architecture and DDD principles can be effectively implemented in a Go project. This initiative extends beyond creating a JSON REST API and persisting data in a SQLite database. It ambitiously integrates a simple yet modern frontend designed with the increasingly popular Tailwind, Alpine.js, and HTMX technologies.

This venture seeks not only to showcase the versatility and robustness of these web development tools but also to illuminate the adaptability of Clean Architecture and DDD principles across different programming languages and frameworks.
